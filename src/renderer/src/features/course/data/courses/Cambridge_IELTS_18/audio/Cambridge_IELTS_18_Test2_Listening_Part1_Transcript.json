There will be time for you to read the instructions and questions and you will have a chance to check your work. All the recordings will be played once only. The test is in four parts. At the end of the test you will be given 10 minutes to transfer your answers to an answer sheet. Now turn to part one. Part one. You will hear a woman from a job agency giving information to a man about work in a chain of restaurants. First, you have some time to look at questions one to five. Now listen carefully and answer questions 1 to 5."

Oh, right. They're looking for a breakfast supervisor. That would be OK. So you're probably familiar with the kind of responsibilities involved. Obviously checking that all the portions are correct, etc. And then things like checking all the procedures for cleaning the equipment"

Right. I know that if they like you, it's likely you'll be promoted quite quickly, so that's worth thinking about. Yes, it does sound interesting. What are the hours like? The usual, I think. There's a lot of evening and weekend work, but they're closed on Mondays. But you do get one Sunday off every four weeks. So, would you like me to send off your CV?"
