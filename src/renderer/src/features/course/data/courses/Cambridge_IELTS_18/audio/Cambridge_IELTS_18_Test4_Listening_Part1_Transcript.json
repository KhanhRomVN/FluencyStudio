There will be time for you to read the instructions and questions and you will have a chance to check your work. All the recordings will be played once only. The test is in four parts. At the end of the test, you will be given 10 minutes to transfer your answers to an answer sheet. Now turn to part one. Part one. You will hear a man who works at an employment agency phoning a woman who is looking for a job. First, you have some time to look at questions one to five. Now listen carefully and answer questions one to five."
